# weBook 

Fullstack project in progress using NextJs, Sequelize, Supabase, JWT and MaterialUI. The project is a prototype of a book social network, where users can search for books (using Google and NYT APIs), bookmark or add them to different 'shelves', write reviews and read reviews from other users, and other forms of interaction still being implemented.

<p>To install the dependencies it is necessary to run the commands "npm install" and "yarn add".</p>
